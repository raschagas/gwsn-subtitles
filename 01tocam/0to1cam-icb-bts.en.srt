1
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:08,841
This is a style that I prepared with ambition.

2
00:00:08,841 --> 00:00:09,660
Right now...

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,250
only one eye has lens.

4
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:20,719
I got these new lenses for "I Can't Breathe" stages.

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:27,226
I bought it intending to use both, but...

6
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:31,697
I thought it'd be special if I only wore one.

7
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:38,203
Reflecting on other people's opinions, I'm using one lens today.

8
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:45,844
I will show you more new styles in the remaining performances.

9
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:49,715
It's too early for you to be surprised because it's so new.

10
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,520
We're going to challenge more styles in the future.

11
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:57,389
I came here today because of "I Can't Breathe"...

12
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:01,894
I also got my hair dyed.

13
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:07,767
Because both Lena and Miya unnie did new colors.

14
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:11,503
If Groos watch it, I think they'll like it.

15
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:14,191
Fighting!

16
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:24,416
Starting today, it's "I Can't Breathe".

17
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:27,286
Oh, I dyed it today.

18
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:30,289
B-side track version.

19
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,292
Lena B-side version.

20
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:41,533
Groo, we came here to do a "I Can't Breathe" performance.

21
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:44,236
I was more nervous than I thought.

22
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,373
I did my best to sing live, though.

23
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:53,045
I'll monitor it later to see if it went well.

24
00:01:53,813 --> 00:02:01,187
There's a day difference between yesterday (Like it Hot) and today, it suddenly turned dark.

25
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:04,890
So I hope that Groos enjoy it!

26
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:09,361
I hope you show a lot of love for "I Can't Breathe" in the future.

27
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:12,999
Today's first broadcast was a success!

28
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:14,600
Bye!

29
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,686
Good morning, Groo!

30
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,056
What time is it now?

31
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:54,673
I went to the beauty saloon at 4 AM....

32
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:57,009
At 4 in the morning.

33
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,414
I'm awake now.

34
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,125
Today is the last broadcast.

35
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:11,690
The saloon threw a surprise party last night.

36
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,358
It was touching.

37
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:22,286
It's the last show, but the manager teased me for being a fool.

38
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:27,606
He can't help it.

39
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,912
Please watch today's stage.

40
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:40,085
I told you it was the last night of "Like it Hot" this week.

41
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:44,356
It's also the first and last night of "I Can't Breathe."

42
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:50,495
We're doing our first and last show of "I Can't Breathe" at Show Champion.

43
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:54,399
I have a point for today.

44
00:03:56,869 --> 00:04:01,540
Our teacher put a heart here, like this.

45
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:06,578
So I'm gonna point to this when I'm crying or laughing.

46
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:10,634
Groo, I love you!

47
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:15,621
Please watch the last performance, okay?

48
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:18,090
See you later!

49
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:23,195
I can't turn my head.

50
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:32,071
It's a historical drama.

51
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:33,105
Your Highness!

52
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:37,209
I have sinned to death!

53
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:47,119
It's a snack box.

54
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,155
It's a snack set.

55
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:54,593
This one I really don't know!

56
00:04:54,661 --> 00:05:01,033
Jelly and... Chocolate Oreo.

57
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,269
This is really tasty.

58
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,875
I ate this this morning.

59
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:12,496
What language is this?

60
00:05:13,297 --> 00:05:14,331
Amazing.

61
00:05:15,933 --> 00:05:20,419
- What country is this from?
- Wow, thank you!

62
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:24,041
- I like this.
- Pretzels?

63
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:31,096
- Let's eat it in the car.
- We'll share it in the car.

64
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:33,498
Thank you!

65
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:43,442
Groo, I'll be back after the last performance.

66
00:05:43,442 --> 00:05:45,829
Bye!

67
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:53,853
[Seoryeong is husky for giving it all in the last broadcast]
The last night of "I Can't Breathe" is over...

68
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:58,423
It was something I've been waiting for, but it's a pity that time passed so quickly.

69
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:05,163
[Seoryeong is husky for giving it all in the last broadcast]
It was the last night, so I wanted to do well.

70
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:11,655
I'm sorry I don't have more opportunities to show you more.

71
00:06:11,655 --> 00:06:16,341
I'm missing something else...

72
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:23,482
If there were more opportunities, I could show you a little bit more.

73
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:29,554
Still, I think I showed everything on stage, because I worked really hard.

74
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:34,126
Please enjoy this performance and look forward to the next schedules.

75
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,246
Thank you very much!

76
00:06:35,246 --> 00:06:39,664
[TALKING ABOUT HAIRSTYLES FOR CHARACTERS IN MOVIES...]

77
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,625
I've been growing this hair for a year!

78
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,036
Let's go!
