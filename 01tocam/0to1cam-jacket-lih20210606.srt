1
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:30,270
Painter team?

00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,680

00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,680
[Bright mood]

4
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:30,300
Yeah, our painter team~

5
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,350
Our jacket shooting is over!

6
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,290
Yes, we took pictures in the MV shooting site

7
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:41,730
for the jacket shooting!

8
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,950
In this photo album...

9
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,470
we used the same backgrounds as in the MV...

10
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:52,270
I believe the MV will focus more into the scenes.

11
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,710
You think so too?

12
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,340
Over there...

13
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,480
We filmed the music video there earlier,

14
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,680
but I also shot the jacket here.

15
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,070
The photos came out really nice because...

16
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,350
it is so colorful and the light was shining on it!

17
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:09,290
Listen! I watched it from behind the scenes!

18
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:10,590
Very beautiful!

19
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,660
It came out really pretty!

20
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,400
Seokyoung is looking cool,

21
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,100
but she was really cute, to be honest.

22
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,100
I just pretended to be cool!

23
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,770
But because of these dumplings...

24
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,200
It was so cute!

25
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,690
It's true!

26
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,740
Lena also completely changed her style...

27
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,080
her feeling has changed, but she's so pretty!

28
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,430
But honestly,

29
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,350
what kind of pose should I do with this styling?

30
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,480
It's still a little difficult.

31
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,750
We're getting used to it while filming today!

32
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,090
You were very good! What?!

33
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:40,860
Really?

34
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,220
Really, really good!

35
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,590
And now the other team is getting ready outside!

36
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,530
I'm really looking forward to it!

37
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,200
Everyone, are you curious?

38
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,070
We can see the car now...

39
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,840
I'll just say this!

40
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,140
Learn about it as you watch!

41
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,490
Let's move on to the next camera team!

42
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,610
One, two, three!

43
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,950
I'm doing a jacket shooting!

44
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,520
Isn't that cool?

45
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,490
The always cool Miya...

46
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,470
[Miya moving to the next scene!]

47
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:33,160
Now I changed into a black and white dress!

48
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,300
The first outfit was sporty~

49
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:43,400
Jogger pants and a crop top, dressed sporty.

50
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:47,940
We were a little more chic and cool,

51
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:53,010
and now we have a more moody feeling.

52
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,450
Being pretty...

53
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,020
cool...

54
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,620
charismatic...

55
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,390
I'll do it all!

56
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:03,090
I have to take individual pictures now,

57
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,430
and then a group photo shoot!

58
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,500
I'm waiting because I haven't finished filming.

59
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,000
Please pray for a good photo shoot, everyone!

60
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,870
Let's pray together, groos!

61
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:07,680
