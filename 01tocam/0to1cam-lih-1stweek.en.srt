158
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,560
Yes, that's the state of today's interview...

159
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,100
Last in order!

160
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:00,130
The best in the world... the cutest...

161
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:04,040
she's the prettiest and she's introducing
the members.

162
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:09,480
There are people who say, "this person
is crazy..."

163
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,240
Now!

164
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,610
Minju! Hello!

165
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:17,180
Yes, I'm going to interview Minju today.

166
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,180
Miss Minju!

167
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,750
Can you tell me about your first stage?

168
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,420
Oh, I'm looking forward to the first broadcast!

169
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:27,360
Uh... I'm so excited to go up on stage!

170
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,600
Ah, thank you, miss Minju!

171
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,800
Please work hard today! Fighting!

172
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,400
Then the interview ends here.

173
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,400
Bye!

174
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,740
[Interview done!]

175
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,910
 Well, today is Music Bank's first stage!
Fighting!

176
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,240
Girls in the Park!

177
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,010
1, 2, 3, fighting!

178
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:46,980
30/05/21 "Like it Hot" at Inkigayo
[Hi, groos!]

179
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:51,000
Where are we?
This is Inkigayo!
30/05/21 "Like it Hot" at Inkigayo

180
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,020
Where are we?
This is Inkigayo!

181
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:56,190
I did a ponytail today.
Here's a cute invisible ribbon holding it.

182
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:04,030
Today we're going to rehearse in our outfits!

183
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,030
Fighting!

184
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,730
Bye!

185
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,100
Hi!

186
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,710
Today, we are preparing for Inkigayo on Sunday!

187
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,380
Exactly.

188
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,640
Today is the pre-recording!

189
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,280
This way we are preparing fast!

190
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:24,550
- I got a notice that there is a fancam today.
- That's right!

191
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,890
I am very nervous.

192
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,860
- You'll be fine even though you're nervous?
- Yes, I will.

193
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:30,880
- For today's concept, we have shiny extensions!
- Greet the camera, Miya unnie!
- You'll be fine even though you're nervous?
- Yes, I will.

194
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:39,570
- For today's concept, we have shiny extensions!
- Greet the camera, Miya unnie!

195
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,800
Hello, this is Miya!

196
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,940
My hair...

197
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,040
[Miya getting interrupted]

198
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:54,410
Oh, I didn't know you were in the middle
of an interview!

199
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,150
Hi!

200
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:03,990
We're at Inkigayo today!

201
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,090
First Inkigayo this comeback!

202
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,130
The stage is so pretty and...

203
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:12,130
The stage is pretty and the members are prettier.

204
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,170
Thanks!

205
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:17,140
Actually, I really wanted to compliment you.

206
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,140
I know (x3)

207
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,070
[You knew it! As expected!]

208
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,510
- I... I know how you feel!
- Oh, really?

209
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:30,850
In fact, aren't we going to be ending fairies today?

210
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:33,350
- That's right!
- We're doing the ending too!

211
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:38,020
- The point for the ending fairy is us!
- Lena wouldn't have done it without our hands.

212
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,780
[01's are the best!]

213
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:44,430
Today was the last music show of the first week.

214
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:49,040
First of all, it's the first week, and it's been too long since we've
had a music show.

215
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,740
I think it was a little... very difficult.

216
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:58,080
Still... I think there's
something a little awkward about it.

217
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,310
So, starting next week, I'll be a little closer (with the camera).

218
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,190
We'll come back prettier!

219
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:13,530
Uh, I was very worried... because it's been so long.

220
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:16,530
Also, the practice room and the stage are different.

221
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:20,570
What if you can't find the camera?

222
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:23,990
If you're nervous on stage, you might laugh.

223
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,630
Of course, I'm practicing to prevent that.

224
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:30,860
I've worried a lot about it.

225
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:35,200
We've had our first week with a very nervous mind.

226
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:42,620
I got used to it quickly because it's our 5th mini album.

227
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:47,390
I think we'll be able to show you a better performance!

228
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,500
How is "Like it Hot", everyone?

229
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,170
That's right! I like it, too!

230
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,340
Bye!

231
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:00,740
Is the first week already gone?

232
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:09,650
It's a little sad the time we have left is getting smaller and smaller because I want to show you more.

233
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:12,350
It's been a while since we've been on this show.

234
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,850
I don't want to go in!

235
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:18,120
I want to look prettier to Groo.

236
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:24,960
You're going to watch the performance, right?

237
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:25,870
You're going to watch, right?

238
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:29,440
Please watch the rest of the broadcasts.

239
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,060
Bye!

240
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,230
Groos, hi!

241
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:40,410
I'm getting fixed and then going to the practice room.

242
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:43,180
We haven't been here in a very long time!

243
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:49,390
But a lot of people were waiting for us.

244
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,560
I was so touched.

245
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:56,160
Many people looked forward to it and
gave me good compliments.

246
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,730
So we want to do better for the rest
of the promotions.

247
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:01,230
I have a strong desire to do better!

248
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,470
I worked hard on today's broadcast.

249
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:07,410
I hope you enjoy watching it!

250
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:09,040
Fighting!

251
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,680
We come here every time we comeback!

252
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,750
4th time?

253
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:21,220
I feel I can relax more on stage now.

254
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:28,490
We'll be back next week with the members.

255
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,160
I believe you'll be able to see various gestures!

256
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,440
We had a fun stage today! Please enjoy it!

257
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,340
You know I watch you when you whisper
"Like it Hot" at the beginning?

258
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,980
- Miya unnie is acting cool.
- I whispered lightly today.

259
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,350
Did you? Did you?

260
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:51,320
I'll do this move next week. I look forward to it!

261
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:56,790
Where are we now? This is...

262
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,430
This is Inkigayo!

263
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:05,400
Today we had the first "Like it Hot"
performance of Inkigayo.

264
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:11,600
I didn't think about the ending, so I went up on
stage, and before the recording.

265
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:16,710
You said I was the ending fairy today, but I was like

266
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:20,010
'I'm not doing the same thing as everyone?' and then...

267
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,050
What? Do I have to do something?

268
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:30,620
"I'm sure you'll do something cute" you guys said.
So I got a little embarassed.

269
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,630
But Soso unnie and Minju unnie helped me.

270
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:39,100
So, check out what I've done in the broadcast!

271
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,330
Again... I liked it a lot.

272
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:45,040
The producers of Inkigayo did a great job.

273
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,470
I did it with confidence!

274
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:53,050
It's our first time doing it, so we're going to show you more stages in the future with more confidence.

275
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,350
Bye!
